Table: Customer

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+


-- solution --
SELECT name FROM customers WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL

-- A field with a null value is a field with no value. It is different from a 0 value or a field that contains spaces. It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators. Instead we have to use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL operators instead
